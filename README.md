## **What is Decademia?**

Decademia is a marketplace for funding, collaborating and transacting early-stage scientific research projects. Researchers get to present their research projects, find investors and collaborators and advance their research projects. Investors and funds get exposure to new domain-specific research projects looking for funding for their research goals.

Decademia platform infrastructure is built on Polygon enabling researchers and investors full access to the DeFi ecosystem. It's novel approach with the intellectual property NFT (IP-NFT) enables anybody to share ownership on research projects as well as future outcomes such as IP, royalty rights, data and much more.

**The problem weâ€™re solving is :**
Early-stage scientific research suffers from complex legal agreements, missing transparency, and reduced investments. It takes a researcher years to get an investment. As a result, many promising research projects are abandoned before they get off the ground. Academia has termed the problem of missing funds between fundamental research and clinical trial "the valley of death".
Decademia aims to solve the "valley of death" by standardising legal agreements and creating public and liquid markets for funding early-stage research projects.
In essence.
Via Decademia, researchers can offer different legal agreements for assets originating from their research (IP, royalty rights, etc.) and collect the funding they need. Investors can easily fund research and provide the funds in an instant given the integration of cryptocurrencies.

## **Accounts on Decademia:**

Accounts enable users on Decademia Discovery to interact around certain research projects. Researchers can create their own research projects via their accounts. Investors get to inquire about certain projects and whitelist to fund researchers. There are two ways of creating accounts on Decademia Discovery:

**Email Account Creation:** Accounts are being created with an email and password login. The email needs to be verified in a separate step. You can create account via the following link.

**Metamask/Unstoppable Domain Account Creation:** Accounts are being created via web3 enabled wallets. No password is needed, as the signature from the wallet acts as a password. It enalbes account creation and login in one step.

## **For Researchers**

At its core, Decademia's mission is to help biopharma researchers find resources and partners for their research projects. A common challenge in early-stage biopharma research is the lack of funding and the lengthy process of acquiring it. This is mainly due to non-standardized, complex legal agreements, limited access to investors, and the need to align multiple stakeholders..

Decademia tackles these problems with its unique IP-NFT framework. Our team has a collection of standardized legal agreements that will be connected to non-fungible tokens, enabling any researcher to collect funding from existing early-stage investors. No legal entity, no external lawyers needed.

**Intellectual property NFTs (IP-NFTs)**

To get access to the market of investors, your research project will be tokenized. This basically means, that a unique digital representation of the research project will be added to the blockchain in the form of a non-fungible token. This token will link to a legal agreement that you will have formed with investors.

### **How to create an IP-NFT?**

**[Decademia Discovery](https://www.decademia.org/createProject)** hosts different scienfitic research projects from all around the world. Researchers present their research projects from the different therapeutic areas. The site enables you to sort by different Clinical Stages, Opportunity Types, and gives you a free text search option.
To achieve your goal of having funding acquired via Decademia several steps are needed. Our team is happy to assist you in walking you through the steps and answer any arising questions:

1.**Create a researcher account** on [Decademia Discover](https://www.decademia.org/createProject).

2.**Create a project draft** under the "create project" tab. Don't worry if you cannot fill all fields immediately. You can save the draft and work on it later before publishing. Our team is also happy to assist you.

3.**Publish research project** for investors to see your project. You can edit your research project under the "My projects" tab and publish it when you deem it ready.

4.**Start attract investors:** Make investors aware of your project by reaching out to research communities among your peers and web3. Get in touch with the Decademia Team (info@decademia.org). We are happy to feature your research project and highlight it with the investor network.

5.**Align on legal terms:** Reach out to the decademia (info@decademia.org ) to start the IP-NFT process. We will provide you with legal documents and help you fit them to your use-cases. If needed, we support you in the process of aligning with your local TTO.

6.**Create IP-NFT:** Once the legal agreement exists, we are ready to create your IP-NFT. The Decademia team will create it for you and inform as soon as it is ready. After its creation, investors are now able to offer you funding in return of the IP-NFT and the connected legal agreement

7.**Receive Funds:** Accept an offer from a investor to fund you research project. Once accepted, the investor will transfer the funds. The Decademia team will help you bridge them from cryptocurrencies into your native currency. Now you are ready to start your research!

## **For Investors**

You probably arrived here to support developments in the science research space. We are happy to have you and would like to help you make the most of any resources you are willing to invest into research projects.

In the process of becoming a listed project on Decademia, our team has carefully vested and supported the researchers in setting up their research projects. 

## **How to invest in research**

Currently, every investor needs to be a verified user on Decademia to invest in research projects. To enable you to directly invest in a research project, we need some minor data

1. 1.**Create an investor account** on [Decademia Investor](https://www.decademia.org/)
2. 2.**Explore research projects** in your field of interest. If you want to get in touch with specific researchers that have no contact information listed, feel free to reach out to us via info@decademia.org
3. 3.**Get whitelisted for IP-NFT sales:** For participating in IP-NFT sales and making binding offers to researchers, Decademia needs to collect certain information about the investors. This information will be used primarily to enable investors to sign the underlying legal agreements connected to IP-NFTs. *To trigger the whitelisting process please get in touch with* info@decademia.org
4. 4.**Bid on IP-NFTs:** You are now ready to create offers for to-be funded research projects or existing IPNFTs. We will keep you informed of new funding opportunities arising on Decademia. If you are interested in funding research projects which are not listed on Decademia yet, feel free to put the researcher in touch with the Decademia team.
5. 5.**Transfer of funds and receiving the IPNFT:** After your bid has been accepted by a researcher, you will be asked to transfer the funds to an escrow account. As soon as the funds are received, the escrow contract will release the IPNFT to the origin address of the funds.
6. 6.**Manage your IPNFT:** After you have received the IPNFT, you are now able to manage it on the Decademia platform. View the IPNFT, make selling offers, or review the underlying legal agreement and data (to be added) via the Decademia platform  ****
